# Open-Source-Models-with-Hugging-Face-DeepLearning.AI  

In this repository, I document my learning process from the **DeepLearning.AI** short courses on Hugging Face and Transformers.  

- ðŸ“˜ **Course 1:** [Open-Source Models with Hugging Face](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/open-source-models-hugging-face)  
- ðŸ“˜ **Course 2:** [Attention in Transformers: Concepts and Code in PyTorch](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/attention-in-transformers-concepts-and-code-in-pytorch)  

### Contents
- My study notes on Hugging Face (tasks, models, pipelines, Open LLM Leaderboard, etc.)  
- Reports and summaries about **Transformers** (attention mechanisms, PyTorch code, and related concepts)  
- Example code snippets and experiments as I progress through the courses

ðŸ’¡ This repo is mainly for **tracking my learning journey**, sharing insights, and keeping useful references for future projects.
